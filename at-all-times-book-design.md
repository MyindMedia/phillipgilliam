## Back Cover Synopsis

Former Baltimore homicide detective John Talion thought he'd seen the worst humanity could offer. He was wrong.

When a prominent clockmaker is found murdered—his body suspended from the historic Emerson Tower clock face—Baltimore's elite demand answers. The killer left only one clue: a pocket watch stopped at 3:33, with inscription *"At All Times."*

Talion is drawn into a labyrinth of old money, family secrets, and a conspiracy that spans generations. As the body count rises, each victim found at a different historical clock tower across the city, Talion realizes he's hunting not just a killer, but a man obsessed with time itself—and the terrible debt he believes the city owes him.

From the cobblestone streets of Fells Point to the marble corridors of power, Talion must navigate a world where the past and present collide. And this time, the femme fatale who hires him may be hiding the deadliest secret of all.

In a race against time that might already be lost, how far will Talion go to stop a killer who believes clocks are more than instruments—they're invitations?
