            <div class="reveal" style="transition-delay: 0.1s;">
                <p>Early summer nights, they're mystical. On this night, the skyline of a high-end Baltimore City
                    condominium complex folds into a plush apartment with a stylish, feminine touch. Inside the soft
                    light and warm night air, the balmy water bathes the tanned, firm body of a beautiful young woman.
                </p>

                <p>Sharon Bowling steps out of the shower and grabs a towel to tap dry her delicate skin in the steam
                    and faint breeze from the open bathroom window.</p>

                <p>She strolls down the hallway, answering her phone. "Yes. I'm just out of the shower," she says.</p>

                <p>The man's raspy voice responds with anxious anticipation. "Good. Don't get dressed. I want the
                    blindfold, the red shoes, and nothing else," he commands, his voice deep as the summer night.</p>

                <p>Not long after, there is a light knock at the young woman's door. Approaching the door with a
                    mingling of desire and regret, she stops and breathes deep. Then, with a sigh of acquiescence, she
                    pulls the blindfold down over her eyes. As she opens her door, their lust is realized as the thick
                    air between them mixes her exquisite perfume with the restrained strength of his cologne.</p>

                <p>The man, tall with dark hair and a muscular build, extends his right hand slowly to close the
                    distance and push the blindfolded Sharon firmly to the wall just inside her door. Sliding his hand
                    down the front of her short, black camisole, he slips it up underneath to touch the inside of her
                    tender thighs, rising over her nipples to gently palm her soft breast. Giving her a strong kiss, he
                    whispers, "Nothing else, I said."</p>

                <p>He bends slowly, going to his knees and throwing both her firm thighs over his shoulders, lifting her
                    up in the air until she's bracing herself against the low ceiling, relaxing her pelvis while moaning
                    in pleasure. After a few moments, he slides her down, pressed close against the wall, and kisses her
                    again. As she tastes her own essence, he slips deep inside her, providing the thick, muscular fuck
                    their lust demanded.</p>

                <p>Later, the young woman stares closely into her bathroom mirror, struggling to fix her hair and her
                    lipstick as she hears a light knock at the door. Her eyes glance there, then back to the mirror.
                    "One minute."</p>

                <p>Sharon opens the bathroom door as her lover steps just inside to take hold of her, caressing and
                    exploring her as he leads her down the hall to the front door. She touches his face, exposing a rose
                    tattoo on her hand. He gazes down her naked body to her red pumps.</p>

                <p>"Nice shoes," he says, putting his wedding ring back on. He gives a wry smile, another strong kiss,
                    then leaves. Sharon closes the apartment door behind him and leans against the wall.</p>

                <p>The apartment is completely quiet for a moment, and she stares expressionless as the silence is
                    broken by a familiar voice.</p>

                <p>"Hey, baby sis! Where are you? Where are my damn shoes? Call me!" The voice mail message ends with a
                    laugh.</p>

                <p>At the downstairs exit, Sharon's lover leaves the apartment complex and goes out the front of the
                    building. He glances at the mingling of young men looking disapprovingly at him as he walks to his
                    car, the sleek, expensive lines out of place in this neighborhood. He presses the start button on
                    his keychain, and the doors open as the car starts. He enters the vehicle and reaches to tune the
                    radio to a smooth jazz station.</p>

                <p>All the young men leave, except one who walks towards Sharon's lover, still sitting in his car. As
                    that young man gets closer, he slips a handgun from his pocket. Then, from the distant left, a
                    second man, with labored breathing, begins drifting up behind the first young man, just out of the
                    young man's sight.</p>

                <p>The heavy breather gradually moves to the side of the young man, who is pulling his gun on Sharon's
                    lover, in his car. With a twelve-gauge shotgun in his own hands, he steps to the side of the young
                    man and blows the side of his head off. He stands still for a second, still aiming at the dead young
                    man. Stunned, Sharon's lover tries to gather himself. Breathing heavier, the man glances over, then
                    slowly shifts his shotgun, trains it on Sharon's startled lover, then shoots him at point-blank
                    range.</p>

                <p>The second man takes a few more seconds to empty his victim's pockets and remove his Rolex watch,
                    then exhales before casually walking away. Sharon's lover, a pool of blood staining his leather
                    seats, twitches once, then is still.</p>

                <p>A week later, Samantha Bowling-Vaccorro sits next to her sister, Sharon. She and other family members
                    stare at a portrait of her husband, Jason Vaccorro. The casket is closed.</p>

                <p>Her sister reaches out both hands to console Samantha, and Samantha smiles sadly. Samantha, wiping
                    the tears that have already ruined her makeup, grabs her sister's hand and brings it close to her
                    face, exposing her sister's rose tattoo as Sharon awkwardly tries to console her.</p>

            <h2 class="chapter-title drama-serif reveal">CHAPTER 2</h2>

            <div class="reveal" style="transition-delay: 0.1s;">
                <p>Three months later</p>

                <p>A misty night air and light drizzle envelopes a small city park bordered by two streets on both
                    sides. Across the small park, in the alley behind a stately museum, a vagrant is sleeping in a
                    makeshift box-shelter. The park is quiet and dark.</p>

                <p>John Talion, a thirty-eight-year-old ex-homicide detective, is working as a contract investigator. He
                    lies on a park bench, rubbing his face and hair. He sits up, glances at the familiar vagrant, and
                    mumbles to himself, "Well, it's just you and me, Old Bernie. The hell are we both doing here?</p>

                <p>It's the need that put us here. Well, I believe there's honor in hard work. Now, I'm honorably
                    sitting in the rain, looking into this window where a wife, someone else's wife, is giving an
                    unscheduled blowjob to her lover. My job is to film it and show it to the poor bastard who's paying
                    me to find out if she's been unfaithful." He releases a dispassionate exhale as he lifts his camera.
                </p>

                <p>John focuses on the third-floor window of a row of Victorian buildings opposite the museum. He
                    photographs a man and a woman kissing passionately. The woman leans back, then slowly descends to
                    her knees into the silhouette of performing enthusiastic fellatio. Only the top of her head is
                    visible from John's park bench viewpoint. John stares at the couple, then looks down, indifference
                    covering his face.</p>

                <p>The area and alley around the museum are deserted, except for the handsome man and petite, beautiful
                    woman walking hand in hand casually past the opening. The woman stops, smiles, then redirects their
                    walk into the alley with a laugh. She stops again and leans against the wall, pulling the man in
                    close while caressing his thick arms.</p>

                <p>"Will you?" the man asks.</p>

                <p>"Oh yes, I will," the woman responds.</p>

                <p>Glancing around for privacy, the man quickly has his hands all over her. He reaches into her open
                    blouse to gently massage her breast as she pushes towards him. He gently strokes her hair with his
                    other hand, then swiftly grips her throat, lifting her slowly off the ground, scraping and grinding
                    the back of her head against the brick wall.</p>

                <p>Her splintering fingernails scrape into the wall as she rises. He removes his other hand from her
                    blouse, exposing one of her breasts, then reaches into his coat for a boning knife. He chuckles,
                    slowly bringing her down to eye level while peering deeply into her bulging eyes. Pinning her by the
                    neck against the wall, he leans into her and licks her whole face. The woman, now understanding that
                    her companion is murdering her, strains to release one last muffled scream.</p>

                <p>"No, please! Please!"</p>

                <p>He smiles slightly, giving her a soft, slow kiss while slipping the knife into her ribs. His lips
                    remain locked with his victim as small drops of blood spill into the kiss.</p>

                <p>Slowly, he stabs her over and over as she is lowered down to the ground, only then releasing his kiss
                    of death. He kneels down, face speckled with blood, gazing into her eyes to determine the instant
                    life leaves her body.</p>

                <p>With a surgeon's precision, the man continues to cut and slice her. Then, in mid-stab, he stops,
                    removing the blood-soaked knife from her chest. Carefully he reaches down, taking her left hand and
                    mechanically wrenching her pinky from its socket.</p>

                <p>He stands, surveys his work, then starts slowly walking away. Increasing his pace, he races past the
                    vagrant, Bernie, and out of the alley. His footsteps make almost no sound in the silent, warm night.
                </p>

                <p>In the alley, the woman's butchered body lays prone, her eyes wide open as a lone drop of blood drips
                    off her eyelid. The destruction is absolute, her grimace of fear and sorrow the final testament to
                    her last grasp on life.</p>

                <p>Sprinting directly at John, the man makes one quiet, mechanical turn, gliding past John on the park
                    bench. Sensing motion, John looks up quickly to see a lone figure almost a block away. He then turns
                    toward the sound of a crash as the vagrant stumbles over a trashcan at the edge of the alley. The
                    trashcan lid rolls into the street, where it's hit by a passing car which continues straight on,
                    unfazed. Silence reigns again, broken only by the insufficient mumblings of the vagrant struggling
                    to form the words, "Murder, murder!"</p>

                <p>John stands and gains his balance, moving towards the terrified man, who is pointing down the alley.
                    Sprinting into the narrow passageway, John sees blood leaking into the drain water and a woman in a
                    white blouse and skirt, turned red with blood.</p>

                <p>She is laying face-up in complete submission, her blouse open and her entrails placed neatly outside
                    the body. A pinkie finger in the center of the display stands like a gruesome candle on a death day
                    cake.</p>
